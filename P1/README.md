This purpose of this project was to write two different implementations of the List data structure.

The first implementation is NumArrayList, and the second is NumLinkedList, which both implement the NumList interface.

Then, I needed to write a class that represents a set- like a list, but with different constraints, like order/repetition not mattering. I made the NumSet class by extending the NumArrayList. 

Included are some basic tests required as part of the assignment.
