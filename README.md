This repository holds my three projects for EECS233 - Data Structures from the Fall 2015 semester.

Project 1 was to implement the List data structure.

Project 2 was to make a text compression program using Huffman encoding.

Project 3 was to write an 8-puzzle solver using DFS and BFS.

My project 2 does not correctly compress files.
