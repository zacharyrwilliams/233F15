These are the projects done for EECS233 - Data Structures.

The zero-th project is literally just FizzBuzz, speaking of which, I'm not sure I saved into this folder yet, which I should do at some point. But it's FizzBuzz anyway, so it's not like anyone will care.

The first project is an implementation of ArrayList and LinkedList.

The second project is an implementation of the Huffman's coding algorithm for a compression program.

The third and fourth projects have not yet been assigned.
